# Transform with Azure AI, Data and Apps Platform!

Welcome to the Innovate. Ignite. Inspire : Transform with Azure AI, Data and Apps Platform workshop! In this workshop, we’ll talk about these emerging patterns and show how Azure AI empowers developers to build multi-agent copilot solutions. Discover advanced features such as model selection, debugging tools and security measures for developing intelligent, scalable, and safe AI solutions.
You will learn about:
- Build high-quality LLM-based applications with Azure AI Services and Azure AI Studio
- Operationalize and scale the management of your GenAI applications
- Innovate confidently by building and designing with responsible AI practices
