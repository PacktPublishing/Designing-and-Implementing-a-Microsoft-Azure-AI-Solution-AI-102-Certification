These APIs support both interactive speech recognition and batch transcription, making them adaptable to various audio lengths and volumes. Developers typically access these services through language-specific SDKs, such as Python or C#.

## Chapter 8. Working on Generative AI Solutions
* use the following URL to jump straight to it: https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesOpenAI
* To view full pricing details at https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/cognitive-services/openai-service/
* Region: Model availability can differ by region, so ensure the model you want to deploy is accessible in your chosen location. Additionally, consider performance and compliance factors, such as data residency requirements, which may affect your selection. For more details, visit this link: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/concepts/models
* Deployment type: There are four main deployment types: Global-Batch, Global-Standard, Standard, and Provisioned. Global-Batch deployments are designed for offline scoring workloads that are not latency-sensitive and can be completed within hours. Global-Standard deployments leverage Azure's global infrastructure to provide higher initial throughput and dynamic routing. Standard and Provisioned deployments are optimized for regional data residency requirements, offering consistent, high-volume real-time scoring. For more details, visit this link: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/deployment-types
* Quota: Quotas determine the maximum resources, such as tokens per minute (TPM), that can be allocated to a model deployment in a specific region. For instance, you might have a quota allowing a single deployment with 240,000 TPM or multiple deployments that collectively reach this limit. You can adjust your TPM allocation post-deployment through the Azure AI Foundry, providing flexibility to manage resources according to your needs. For more details, visit this link: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/quotas-limits
* If you choose System-assigned managed identity, ensure that role assignments are set up correctly. For more details, please refer to the link at https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/use-your-data-securely#role-assignments.
* Ensure that your Azure OpenAI resource is created in an available region. You can visit https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/concepts/models#fine-tuning-models to check which fine-tuning models are available in which regions.
